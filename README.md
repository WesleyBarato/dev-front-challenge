🚀 Tech Career Simulation: Student Challenge
This repository contains one of the technical challenges designed for my students at Senac Gravataí. The goal is to simulate a real-world hiring process, bridging the gap between classroom learning and the professional tech market.

📌 The Project Concept
As a teacher, I developed this simulation to prepare students for the dynamics of the IT industry. The activity is divided into three main phases:

The Job Posting: Students are presented with three distinct job descriptions (Front-end, Full Stack, and Database).

The Application: Students must select a position, prepare a resume, and write a professional email explaining why they are a good fit for the role.

The Technical Challenge: Upon "applying," students receive a technical requirement and a strict 2-day deadline to deliver a functional solution from scratch.

🎯 Objective
The core mission is to train a "Developer Mindset." Beyond just writing code (Hard Skills), students must practice:

Soft Skills: Professional communication and email etiquette.

Time Management: Working under a tight deadline.

Git Flow: Managing their progress through commits and repository organization.

Problem Solving: Interpreting requirements and delivering a minimum viable product (MVP).

🛠️ Stack Selection
This specific repository focuses on the [INSERT STACK NAME HERE, e.g., Front-end] challenge, utilizing:

Languages/Tools: [e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL]

Methodology: Agile-based task management.
