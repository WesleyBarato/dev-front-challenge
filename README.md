# 🚀 Tech Career Simulation: Student Challenge

This repository contains one of the technical challenges designed for my students at **Senac Gravataí**.  
The goal is to simulate a **real-world hiring process**, bridging the gap between classroom learning and the professional tech market.

## 🌤️ Front-end Challenge: Weather Dashboard & Outfit Suggestions

### 💡 Concept
Create a website that consumes a weather forecast API (e.g., *OpenWeather*) and, based on the current temperature, suggests what the user should wear or do  
(e.g., *"It's 15°C, bring a jacket!"*).

### 📋 Requirements
1. City search input.
2. Central card displaying:
   - Current temperature
   - Humidity
   - Weather icon
3. JavaScript logic to display dynamic messages based on temperature.
4. Fully responsive layout (**mobile-first**).

### 📦 Delivery
- **Deadline:** 02/10  
- **Submission:** Send the project repository link on GitHub.

## 📌 Project Concept

As a teacher, I developed this simulation to prepare students for the **dynamics of the IT industry**.  
The activity is divided into **three main phases**:

### 1️⃣ The Job Posting
Students are presented with three distinct job descriptions:
- Front-end Developer
- Full Stack Developer
- Database Developer

### 2️⃣ The Application
Students must:
- Select a position
- Prepare a professional resume
- Write a formal email explaining why they are a good fit for the role

### 3️⃣ The Technical Challenge
After “applying”, students receive:
- A technical requirement
- A **strict 2-day deadline**
- The task of delivering a **functional solution from scratch**

## 🎯 Objective

The core mission is to develop a **Developer Mindset**.  
Beyond writing code (**Hard Skills**), students are challenged to practice:

- 🗣️ **Soft Skills** – Professional communication and email etiquette
- ⏱️ **Time Management** – Working under tight deadlines
- 🌱 **Git Flow** – Commit history, repository organization, and version control
- 🧠 **Problem Solving** – Interpreting requirements and delivering a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
